Still, some of us might want, or need to test stuff out on Apple's operating system, fortunately, there is now a simple solution to do just that, with just one command line.\n\nBecome a channel member to get access to a weekly patroncast and vote on the next topics I'll cover:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw/join\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment\n\nFollow me on Twitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP\n\nMy Gaming on Linux Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw_Lz7oifDb-PZCAcZ07kw\n\nFollow me on ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\nOr join ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\n\nThe Linux Experiment merch: get your goodies there! https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/the-linux-experiment\n\n\nLink to SOSUMI: https://snapcraft.io/install/sosumi/ubuntu\nHow to install snap: https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd\nMac OS Simple KVM: https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM\n\nSosumi is a SNAP package that lets you install a Qemu virtual machine running Mac OS Catalina. It's nothing you couldn't do on your own with a bit more time, but this snap package has the advantage of being just one command line away, and taking care of all the setup for you.\n\nNow be warned that Apple's End User Licence Agreement doesn't allow to run Mac OS in a VM on hardware that isn't made by Apple, so do this at your own risk!\n\nAs always with virtual machines, you need to ensure that your CPU supports virtualization in the BIOS. \n\nOnce you're all set, you just open a terminal window, and run this command:\n\nsudo snap install sosumi\n\nLet the installation run its course, and you should get a menu entry called, you guessed it, SOSUMI.\n\nRun that to initialize the VM. You should get a terminal window which shows you the download progress for the system image that will let you install macOS.\n\nClick inside the window to focus is, and then press enter to start the installer.\nAfter a while, you should end up in the installer window for Mac OS.\n\nTo begin with, you'll have to format the virtual disk that the VM has created for you. Double click on \"disk utility\", and select the disk called \"Apple Inc. VirtIO Block media\", with a size of 68Gb.\n\nThen, click on \"Erase\", and select the format you'd prefer using, I used APFS, as that's the most recent Apple Filesystem, but it will work fine if you use Mac OS Extended.\nClick the \"Erase\" button.\n\nThe operation should be pretty fast, and you can then close the disk utility window, and start the installer by double clicking on \"Reinstall macOS\".\n\nOnce the installation is complete, your VM will reboot and let you complete the first-run setup. You'll end up in Clover again. \nOne last reboot, and you'll be able to select the \"Boot mac OS frm Mac HD\" option in Clover, the last option on the right.\n\nOnce the boot process is complete, you'll have to sift through a few settings screen, and log in using an Apple ID, or create one if you don't already have one.\n\nClose the VM by shutting it down, and open your file manager. Snaps create a folder in your /home directory, to store everything, so head over there, and go to Sosumi, then Common.\n\nHere, you'll find a file called \"launch\". \nFirst, make a copy, in case something goes wrong, so you can restore the previous version, open the file with your text editor of choice.\n\nIn this file, you'll see all the parameters for the Qemu virtual machine.\n\n-m defines the memory usage of the VM, in gigabytes. By default, it's 2, but as I have 32Gb on my device, I'll put 16 in there.\n\nNow, for the window resolution, it's a bit more involved.\n\nType diskutil list\n\nGrab the identifier for the disk that reads EFI,  it should be the same as mine, disk2s1.\n\nThen type\nsudo diskutil mount disk2s1\n\nor replace disk2s1 by the correct identifier for your EFI disk.\n\nNow open the Finder, and go to the EFI disk in the sidebar. Open the CLOVER folder, and ediut the config.plist file, using textedit.\n\nHere, you'll find a line that reads screenresolution. Change the default of 1280x720 by what you want to use, in my case, 1920x1080. Save the file.\n\nNow, shut down the VM, and restart it.\nRight when you see the terminal window open, hit \"escape\". You'll see an interface that looks like a BIOS. Select device manager, OVMF Platform Configuration and then \"change preferred\".\n\nPress the F10 key to save, and then escape until you get back to the main menu, where you'll then select \"Continue\".\n\nYou can also change the CPU core count affected to the VM. By default, you'll get 4 threads for 2 cores, listed in the line \"-smp 4,cores=2\".\nYou can change that by putting another number.","viewCount":372755,"lengthSeconds":774,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1666448210523,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"VLLwTD3j7p4rPnJV"}

While some of them dive deep into the code and show how to implement things, and others explain what is going on via diagrams or math, very few bring all the concepts needed to understand neural networks together, showing diagrams, code, and math side by side. In this video, you will get a clear, step-by-step explanation of neural networks, implementing them from scratch in Numpy, while showing both diagrams that explain how they work and the math that explains why they work. You will cover normal, feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (also from scratch) as well as recurrent neural networks (time permitting). Finally, we‚Äôll be sure to leave time to translate what we learn into performant, flexible PyTorch code so you can apply what you‚Äôve learned to real-world problems.\n\nNo background in neural networks is required, but a familiarity with the terminology of supervised learning (e.g. training set vs. testing set, features vs. target) will be helpful.\n\nDo You Like This Video?

We introduce the idea of a loss function to quantify our unhappiness with a model‚Äôs predictions, and discuss two commonly used loss functions for image classification: the multiclass SVM loss and the multinomial logistic regression loss. We introduce the idea of regularization as a mechanism to fight overfitting, with weight decay as a concrete example. We introduce the idea of optimization and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We also briefly discuss the use of feature representations in computer vision.\n\nKeywords: Image classification, linear classifiers, SVM loss, regularization, multinomial logistic regression, optimization, stochastic gradient descent\n\nSlides:\nhttp://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture3.pdf\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition\n\nInstructors:\nFei-Fei Li: http://vision.stanford.edu/feifeili/\nJustin Johnson: http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/\nSerena Yeung: http://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/\n\nComputer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This lecture collection is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. From this lecture collection, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision.\n\nWebsite:\nhttp://cs231n.stanford.edu/\n\nFor additional learning opportunities please visit:\nhttp://online.stanford.edu/","viewCount":752090,"lengthSeconds":4480,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1672796883148,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"oHAoPEHT4nSA0eZv"}

A well-chosen initialization method would improve learning and accuracy. \n\nIf you were reading my previous tutorial pars, you probably followed my instructions for weight initialization, and it has worked out so far. But how do we choose the initialization for another neural network? In this part, I will show you, that different initialization methods can lead to different results. \n\nA well-chosen initialization can speed up the convergence of gradient descent and increase the odds of gradient descent converging to a lower training error. \n\nI will use code from my last tutorial, where we used to classify circles. Before we used random weights initialization, now we'll try \"He Initialization\", this is named for the first author of He et al., 2015.\n\nFull tutorial code and cats vs dogs image data-set can be found on my GitHub page: https://github.com/pythonlessons/Logistic-regression-step-by-step\n\nText version tutorials: https://pylessons.com/Neural-network-single-layer-part6/\nDeep Neural Networks full video playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3OhRKr3tE\n\n‚úÖ Support My Channel Through Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/PyLessons\n\n‚úÖ One-Time Contribution Through PayPal:\nhttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/PyLessons","viewCount":744,"lengthSeconds":488,"watchProgress":8.569644,"timeWatched":1675193700068,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"wNipJX8LDLOcPuSx"}
